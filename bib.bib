The proposed estimator builds on existing ideas for adaptive smoothing by incorporating information from a pilot density estimate. In addition, we propose a new plug-in bandwidth selection method that is free from the arbitrary normal reference rules used by existing methods. We present simulation examples in which the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and reliability.},

abstract = {Hidden Markov Models (HMM) have proven to be very useful in a
  variety of biomedical applications. The most established method for
  estimating HMM parameters is the maximum likelihood method which has
  shortcomings, such as repeated estimation and penalisation of the
  likelihood score, that are well known. This paper describes an
  Variational learning approach to try and improve on the
  maximum-likelihood estimators. Emphasis lies on the fact, that for
  HMMs with observation models that are from the exponential family of
  distributions, all HMM parameters and hidden state variables can be
  derived from a single loss function, namely the Kullback-Leibler
  Divergence. Practical issues, such as model initialisation and choice
  of model order, are described. The paper concludes by application of
  3 types of observation model HMMs to a variety of biomedical data,
  such as EEG and ECG, from different physiological experiments and
  conditions.},

@article{Stowell2013,
abstract = {Birdsong often contains large amounts of rapid frequency modulation (FM). It is believed that the use or otherwise of FM is adaptive to the acoustic environment, and also that there are specific social uses of FM such as trills in aggressive territorial encounters. Yet temporal fine detail of FM is often absent or obscured in standard audio signal analysis methods such as Fourier analysis or linear prediction. Hence it is important to consider high resolution signal processing techniques for analysis of FM in bird vocalisations. If such methods can be applied at big data scales, this offers a further advantage as large datasets become available. We introduce methods from the signal processing literature which can go beyond spectrogram representations to analyse the fine modulations present in a signal at very short timescales. Focusing primarily on the genus Phylloscopus, we investigate which of a set of four analysis methods most strongly captures the species signal encoded in birdsong. In order to find tools useful in practical analysis of large databases, we also study the computational time taken by the methods, and their robustness to additive noise and MP3 compression. We find three methods which can robustly represent species-correlated FM attributes, and that the simplest method tested also appears to perform the best. We find that features representing the extremes of FM encode species identity supplementary to that captured in frequency features, whereas bandwidth features do not encode additional information. Large-scale FM analysis can efficiently extract information useful for bioacoustic studies, in addition to measures more commonly used to characterise vocalisations.},

@article{Stowell2014,
abstract = {Automatic species classification of birds from their sound is a computational tool of increasing importance in ecology, conservation monitoring and vocal communication studies. To make classification useful in practice, it is crucial to improve its accuracy while ensuring that it can run at big data scales. Many approaches use acoustic measures based on spectrogram-type data, such as the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features which represent a manually-designed summary of spectral information. However, recent work in machine learning has demonstrated that features learnt automatically from data can often outperform manually-designed feature transforms. Feature learning can be performed at large scale and "unsupervised", meaning it requires no manual data labelling, yet it can improve performance on "supervised" tasks such as classification. In this work we introduce a technique for feature learning from large volumes of bird sound recordings, inspired by techniques that have proven useful in other domains. We experimentally compare twelve different feature representations derived from the Mel spectrum (of which six use this technique), using four large and diverse databases of bird vocalisations, with a random forest classifier. We demonstrate that MFCCs are of limited power in this context, leading to worse performance than the raw Mel spectral data. Conversely, we demonstrate that unsupervised feature learning provides a substantial boost over MFCCs and Mel spectra without adding computational complexity after the model has been trained. The boost is particularly notable for single-label classification tasks at large scale. The spectro-temporal activations learned through our procedure resemble spectro-temporal receptive fields calculated from avian primary auditory forebrain.},

Prediction is based on modelling the joint density of MFCC vectors and formant vectors using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Using this GMM and an input MFCC vector, two maximum a posteriori (MAP) prediction methods are developed. The first method predicts formants from the closest, in some sense, cluster to the input MFCC vector, while the second method takes a weighted contribution of formants from all clusters. Experimental results are presented using the ETSI Aurora connected digit database and show that the predicted formant frequency is within 3.25\% of the reference formant frequency, as measured from hand-corrected formant tracks.},

resonator represents a segment of the short-time power spectrum. The
complete spectrum is modeled by a set of digital resonators connected in
parallel. An algorithm based on dynamic programming produces both the
model parameters and the segment boundaries that optimally match the
spectrum. We used this method in experimental tests that were carried
out on the TI digit string data base. The main results of the
experimental tests are: (1) the presented approach produces reliable
estimates of formant frequencies across a wide range of sounds and
speakers; and (2) the estimated formant frequencies were used in a
number of variants for recognition. The best set-up resulted in a string
error rate of 4.2\% on the adult corpus of the TI digit string data base
